0. All features are calculated based on the all orders occured until **the end of 31.01.2021**. The original data is from **new_orders_aggregation.csv**
1. Feature named **u_EF** (Engagement feature). This feature shows us the amount of months that each userID has had at least one order during the period of time.
    - The way to calculate it:
        * For example, userID 10 had following orders overtime:
            * date : order
            * 2.6.21 : 1
            * 13.6.21 : 2
            * 27.6.21 : 1
            * 10.10.21 : 3
        --> **EF  = 2**
2. Feature named **u_avg_orders** shows us the average orders of each userID over the time. It is calculated by the total number of orders of each userID divides the amount of their orders
3. Feature named **u_avg_period**. This feature gives us the information about the average cycle (frequency) that one userID made one order
    - Preprocessing data: 
        * merging userID and date
        * dropping duplicated row ( which have the same userID and date)
    - Then calculating:
        * For example, we know that one user A made an order on normalized_days_list: [23, 41, 50]:
            * **u_avg_period = ((50 - 41) + (41 - 23)) / (len(days_list) - 1) = 13.5**
            * To be clearer, we calculate the average distance between elements in normalized_days_list
4. Features named **u_first_day** and **u_last_day** tell us when is the first day and the last day that one userID made an order
5. Feature **u_std_avg_period** is the standard deviation which is calculated based on the user_avg_period
    - It tells us how spread out the average period of purchasing of each user
    - Method of calculation:
        * For example, we know that one user A made an order on normalized_day_list: [23, 41, 50]:
            * **u_avg_period = ((50 - 41) + (41 - 23)) / (len(days_list) - 1) = 13.5**
            * distance between days in normalized_day_list are: 9, 18
            * u_std_avg_period = $sqr(1/2 * ((9 - 13.5)^2 + (18 - 13.5)^2)) $
6. Feature **u_mean_bought** is the mean value of all days that one user made an order during the period of time
    - For example, we know that one user A made an order on normalized_days_list: [23, 41, 50]:
        * **u_mean_bought = (23 + 41 + 50) / len(normalized_days_list)**
7. Feature **u_std_bought** is the standard deviation which is calculated based on the user_mean_bought. 


- **Explain one observation (each userID)**: For each userID, we know:
    * how many different months in which the user made at least an order (u_EF)
    * the average amount of orders that the user bought (u_avg_orders)
    * the frequency of purchasing (u_avg_period)
    * the first and last normalized days that the user bought something (u_first_bought, u_last_bought)
    * the standard deviation of frequency of purchasing (u_std_avg_period)
    * the mean of normalized day that the user bought something (u_mean_bought) and the standard deviation based on this mean (u_std_bought)
